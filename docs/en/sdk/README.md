# Overview  
LiteOS SDK consists of device-cloud interconnect components, FOTA, JavaScript engine, and sensor framework.

Device-cloud interconnect components are critical to connect devices with limited resources to OceanConnect in the Huawei IoT solution. Device-cloud interconnect components enable device-cloud synergy and integrate a full set of IoT interconnection protocol stacks, such as Lightweight M2M \(LWM2M\), Constrained Application Protocol \(CoAP\), mbed TLS, and lightweight IP \(lwIP\). Based on LWM2M, device-cloud interconnect components provide packaged open APIs for you to quickly and reliably connect applications to OceanConnect. In addition, they help you improve service development efficiency and quickly build products.
